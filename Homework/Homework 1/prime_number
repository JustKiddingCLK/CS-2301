Pseudocode for Homework 1 Part 1

Initialize variables

Prompt user for value
Get value from terminal and store in variable

Loop over all numbers  (x) less than the specified value (v)
    if the v/x is a whole number (hint, use the % operator which returns the remainder of a/b)
        then the value is not prime
        print "This value is not a prime number" to the terminal
        Exit the loop

If v/x was never a whole number
    print "This value is a prime number" to the terminal
