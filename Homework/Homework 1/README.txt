Summary:
The is_prime(num) function will check to see whether numbers are prime numbers.
If num is 0 or 1 then return 0 and if num is divisible by any number other than 1 and num, return 0 because it's not prime
The main function will prompt the user for the number of prime numbers to print. It will start with the first prime number which is 2.
Then it will loop to print the first x prime numbers indicated by user input.
