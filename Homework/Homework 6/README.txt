matrix_calc.c: This file contains the main function. It reads in the input arguments from the command line and calls the appropriate functions from matrix_math.c to perform the matrix addition or subtraction.

matrix_math.c: This file contains the implementation of the matrix math functions and the readMatrix() and deleteMatrix() functions. The readMatrix() function reads in a matrix from a file and creates a struct to store it. The deleteMatrix() function frees the memory used by a matrix struct. The addition() and subtraction() functions take two matrix structs as inputs. They perform the corresponding operation and return the resulting matrix struct.

To run program, run make command. Then run the exe command with the two input files as arguments and then the type of operation. "a" is addition and "s" is subtraction.
